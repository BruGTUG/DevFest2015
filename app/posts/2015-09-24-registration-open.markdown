Register for DevFest Belgium 2015 on October 3-4 at **Famoco** in Brussels. 

### Registration
**Tickets are available through <a href='http://devfest.be/#!/#pricetable'>the website</a>**. Tickets for the whole weekend are €11 total. You can select which parts you are interested in through the separate registrations. Of course we intend for everyone to be there the entire weekend!

This year, we've chosen to not make tickets free but ask this small fee, mostly to ensure that we don't have to throw away so much leftover food (high non-attendance if free registration). 

### What's in store?
#### A Moonshot Sprint
Here we are aiming at a diverse group of people who believe they have the power to change the world through science and tech. We invite you to get excited about solving the world's problems by radical thinking. One problem in particular: Youth unemployment. 
Registration is separate; ticket €1; reserved for those interested.
 
#### Tech Talks
Two tracks about Android, IoT, Methodology, UX and Web. We have 12 speakers confirmed so far.

#### Workshops

#### Food and Drinks
Lunch, breakfast and breaks included in an awesome location. 

#### Anything else?
A schedule will appear on the website. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. We'll see you there!
